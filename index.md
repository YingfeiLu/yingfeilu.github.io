  My name is Yingfei Lu, and my Spanish name is Estefanía. I am currently a third-year PhD student in the 
  <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/traduccio" target="_blank">Department of Translation and Language Sciences</a> 
  at 
  <a href="https://www.upf.edu/" target="_blank">Universitat Pompeu Fabra</a>, under the supervision of 
  <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/elisenda-bernal" target="_blank">Dr. Elisenda Bernal</a> 
  and 
  <a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/alba-mila" target="_blank">Dr. Alba Milà-Garcia</a>.
  I am a member of <i><a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/infolex" target="_blank">Infolex</a></i> and <i><a href="https://www.upf.edu/web/tradilex" target="_blank">TraDiLex</a></i>.

I am passionate about languages. I am a native speaker of both Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese, and I hold advanced proficiency in English and Spanish. As a dedicated language learner, I am an avid Super Duolingo user, focusing on German, and I am currently striving to master Catalan through the university’s language center.

Outside of academia, I enjoy traveling, as it allows me to explore new perspectives and cultures. I am also a music enthusiast, with a love for both pop and classical music. I hold an annual pass to L’Auditori in Barcelona, where I regularly attend performances by the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.

In my younger years, I was both a fencing athlete and a cello player.

My motto, Per aspera ad astra ("Through hardships to the stars"), resonates deeply with me, and I often reflect on its Mandarin Chinese translation: 彼此苦旅，以觅繁星 ("Together through life’s struggles, seeking the stars"). This inspires me to persevere in all aspects of life and research.
