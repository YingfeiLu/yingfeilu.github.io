On March 5, 2024, I was honored to be awarded the Joan Oró FI 2024 fellowship to support my doctoral journey. This prestigious fellowship is granted by the Secretariat of Universities and Research of the Department of Research and Universities of the Generalitat of Catalonia, with additional support from the European Social Fund Plus.
