title: "Paper presentation at Word-Formation Theories VII & Typology and Universals in Word-Formation VI"
---

From 25 to 28 June 2025, I attended Word-Formation Theories VII and Typology and Universals in Word-Formation VI, organized by the Department of British and American Studies at Pavol Jozef Šafárik University in Košice, Slovakia.

At the conference, I presented my paper “Word Element Hyper- in English Neologisms: Transitional Directionality Between Derivation and Compounding.”

It was also a valuable opportunity to meet many linguists in person, including Fabio Montermini, Elisa Mattiello, José Sánchez Fajardo, Antonio Fábrega, and Pius ten Hacken, among others.
